# SOL_OOB, project for Operating Systems class at CS UNIPI

To run this shit just clone the repo, cd into folder, then 

$ make && make test 

(this runs the standard test, for more info check relazione.pdf)

**This is NOT and WILL NOT be a perfect project**, it was rushed in order to finish asap, so please don't be angry if there's some nasty stuff.

Still, I will check and merge any good pull request.

Good Coding and please leave me a star if this was helpful :)
